## Elementary Affine Net (EA-NET)

An efficient interaction net system which can be seen as [Symmetric-Interaction-Combinators](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1731/a6e49c6c2afda3e72256ba0afb34957377d3.pdf), extended with node labels. It is desirable for being capable of reducing [EA-CORE](/docs/EA-Core.md) terms optimally. It is designed to be simple and easy to formalize. When extended with primitive numbers, it becomes [FM-NET](/docs/FM-Net.md).
